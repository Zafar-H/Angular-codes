Two types of binding data - interpollation binding and property binnding

interpollation binding :-
- Interpolation refers to embedding expressions into marked up text. By default, interpolation 
uses as its delimiter the double curly braces, {{ and }}.
- example : <h3>Current customer: {{ currentCustomer }}</h3>

property binding
-In the property binding, a template expression appears in quotes to the right of the = symbol 
as in [property]="expression".
- example : <img [src]="itemImageUrl2">
